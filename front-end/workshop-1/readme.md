## Intro
A client appropriately called "Clint" has requested that you make some changes to his existing HTML web page.
## Initial set-up
* Install node?

## Workshop tasks
So far Clint has only created a blank HTML web page. Clint would like you to:
 
1. Add a title (`<title>`) of "Clint's awesome page".
2. Add the following content:
  1. A "Clint's awesome page" header (`<h1>`) at the top of the page
  2. A "Welcome to Clint's page" paragraph (`<p>`) under this header
  3. A second paragraph, containing a link to "www.google.com" 
  4. An image (`<img>`) to display the picture (`pic.jpg`) that Clint has provided in `.\src\img`
