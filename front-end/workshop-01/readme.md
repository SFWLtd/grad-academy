#Front-end workshop 1 (HTML basics)
## Intro
A client appropriately called "Clint" has requested that you make some changes to his existing HTML web page.
## Initial set-up
* Install Node JS (https://nodejs.org/en/) and Git (https://git-scm.com/download/win) if not already done
* Clone grad academy repo from github  
* Open C:\\[grad-academy-repo]\front-end\workshop-01 in Visual Studio Code  
* Open a command prompt, and run the following commands:
```
cd C:\[grad-academy-repo]\front-end\workshop-01
npm install
npm start
```
* Browse to http://localhost:5001

## Workshop tasks
So far Clint has only created a blank HTML web page (`index.html`). Clint would like you to modify this page:
 
1. Add a title (`<title>`) of "Clint's awesome page".
1. Add the following content:
  1. A "Clint's awesome page" heading (`<h1>`) at the top of the page
  1. A "Welcome to Clint's page" heading-2 (`<h2>`) under the `<h1>`
  1. A paragraph under the `<h2>`, containing some text, along with a link to "www.google.com" 
  1. An image (`<img>`) underneath the `<p>` to display the picture (`pic.jpg`) that Clint has provided in `.\src\img`.
